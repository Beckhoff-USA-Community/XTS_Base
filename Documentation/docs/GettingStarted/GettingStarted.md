# Getting Started

## Project Requirements

For new projects, the latest versions of TwinCAT and XTS software should be utilized.

All XTS projects will require:

- [TF5850](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-us/products/automation/twincat/tfxxxx-twincat-3-functions/tf5xxx-motion/tf5850.html)
- [TF5410](https://www.beckhoff.com/en-us/products/automation/twincat/tfxxxx-twincat-3-functions/tf5xxx-motion/tf5410.html)

## Running the Code

This project ships with a ready-to-run oval with a 4m track length and 6 movers that run in simulation mode on your PC, no XTS hardware is required. It can be run as-is for testing and learning purposes.

### Load and Activate

Open the project with TwinCAT. Then activate the configuration using the button on the toolbar.

![Activate Configuration](../Images/GettingStarted/Activate.png)

Confirm that you want to activate the configuration and check the `Autostart PLC Boot Project(s)` option.

![Activate Confirmation](../Images/GettingStarted/Activate-Confirm.png)

You may be prompted to activate a trial license by entering a Captcha. Enter this value to generate the trial license. The project has been designed to work within the limits of a trial license. This license will be valid for 7-days after which it can be renewed indefinitely using this same process.

![Enter Captcha](../Images/GettingStarted/Captcha.png)

Finally select OK to `Restart TwinCAT System in Run Mode`

![Restart in Run](../Images/GettingStarted/RestartRun.png);

Twincat should now be running and can be confirmed by the green icon in the lower right status bar.

### Operate the System

To view the simulated system select `TwinCAT > XTS > XTS Tool Window`.

![XTS Tool Window](../Images/XTSToolWindow.png)

Then select the `Live View` button.

The movers will be idle at this point. To start the movers in motion open the PLC HMI screen at `Base Project > PLC > Main > Main Project > VISUs > Controls`.

![Controls HMI](../Images/GettingStarted/ControlsVisu.png)

The Controls HMI and XTS Tool Window are both dockable windows, arrange them as you desire to view both simultaneously. Here they have been placed side-by-side.

To start the system first click `Enable` to turn on the Mover's servo closed loop control then `Start` to begin the motion sequence.

The three speeds used in the prepared motion sequence can be edited using the text fields next to the control push buttons.

## Project Customization

The base project includes a simulated configuration for a 4m oval track and 6 movers. This will need to be modified to fit your application.

Customizing the system often requires changing the shape or length of the track. This will cause the track's hardware ID number to change and must be updated in the PLC project configuration.

### Configuring XTS Hardware

In order to modify the program to fit a different track configuration, navigate to the XTS Tool Window.

![XTS Tool Window](../Images/XTSToolWindow.png)

Then launch the XTS Configurator and follow the prompts to configure your system.

>The configurator occasionally conflicts with existing settings in the project. To avoid this, it can help to delete the following prior to running the XTS Configurator:

> - XtsProcessingUnit
- All Mover Axis Object
- Existing XTS_Task
- Any hardware in the IO section.

### Initialization Settings

Once your hardware configuration is set, you will need to change a few variable parameters in the code to match the system.

Inside *MOTION > Objects > Collision Avoidance (CA Group)*, set the **Rail Length** parameter to match your hardware.

![CollisionAvoidanceLength](../Images/CALength.png)

Next, open the GVL file within PLC and modify these constants to match your system.

![GlobalVariables](../Images/GlobalVars.png)

Next, check that each of your Axis objects are properly linked to a corresponding Mover object.

!!! Note The project contains *ErrorMover* objects which also appear as options when linking axes. **Do not link axes to these variables.**

![AxisLinks](../Images/AxisLinks.png)

Lastly, open the *XtsProcessingUnit* within SYSTEM and verify that every setting here is correct
